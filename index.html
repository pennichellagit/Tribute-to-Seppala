<h2>1925 serum run to Nome</h2>
<div class="bio">
Seppala played a pivotal role in the historic <span class="bold"><i>"Great Race of Mercy"</span></i> during the diphtheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska in 1925. <br/>
As a skilled musher, Seppala was selected for a dangerous dog sled relay to deliver life-saving diphtheria antitoxin serum to the town. He faced daunting challenges, including treacherous ice on Norton Sound and extreme windchill. <br/> 
Undeterred, Seppala fearlessly led his team across the perilous terrain, covering over 400 miles in freezing temperatures. <br/>
Despite exhaustion and blizzard conditions, he successfully handed over the serum to the next musher, bringing it closer to Nome. <br/>
Seppala's heroic efforts contributed significantly to the successful delivery of the serum, ultimately saving numerous lives in Nome. <br/>
His unwavering determination and exceptional skills as a musher continue to be celebrated through the annual <span class="bold"><i>Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</i></span>, honoring his enduring legacy.</bio>
